==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------

It displays the entire text on page 1232.

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

head books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

tail books/other/pg1232.txt

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------

Spacebar makes the page go down, q closes the text

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------

Less/More would be good to navigate around the text. Tail would be good to see the last lines of a text. Head would be good to see the start of the text. Cat would be good to see the entire text.

==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
----------

wc -w books/other/pg1232.txt
52639 books/other/pg1232.txt
There are 52,639 words.

==========
22.  How many lines are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the line count?
----------

wc -l books/other/pg1232.txt
5063 books/other/pg1232.txt
There are 5,063 lines.
